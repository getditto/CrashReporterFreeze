/*
 This is the platform implementation for peer-to-peer Wifi, or AWDL.
 We use the platform APIs: NetService and NetServiceBrowser to
 initiate the discovery and connection. This is the same high-level
 API from the platform that is used with mDNS as well. We have a
 duplicate implementation because the underlying socket from AWDL
 uses a private socket option called SO_RECV_ANYIF and is defined
 in sys/socket.h on Darwin as 0x1104 (but unavailable in iOS).
 Instead, the only way to get access to the socket is from high-
 level APIs, specifically getInputStream(_:outputStream:) from
 NetService or NWBrowser and NWConnection in the Network Framework,
 (available >=iOS 12).

 We confirmed with Apple DTS that it is ok to run two NetService
 instances:

 "Nothing sticks out to me here as being an issue besides the
 technical overhead of managing the two sets of services and
 browsers."
