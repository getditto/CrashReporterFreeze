/**
 Send and receive messages with remote Ditto peers in the mesh.

 Ditto Bus is separate from the replicated document database. It is used to send one-off messages or
 create continuous channels with other peers in the mesh, without any persistence. Messages are
 treated as opaque binary by Ditto and must be created and interpreted by your app.

 Possible uses include:
 * Remote control systems
 * Tunnelling other protocols
 * Gaming
 * Voice and video

 Ditto Bus communications are always between two distinct peers, 1-to-1, and are offered with
 various delivery guarantees.

 For simple use cases there is a single-message API. These are received on the other peer via
 `DITBusDelegate`.

 In advanced situations with requirements such as multiple overlapping streams, notification of
 stream start and end, and backpressure, individual streams can be opened using the `openStream`
 function. Once opened, these are symmetric/bidirectional message-oriented communication channels.
 The remote peer will receive their stream via `DITBusDelegate`.
