 The identity types you can use with DittoObjC.

 The various identity configurations that you can use when initializing a
 `DITDitto` instance.

 - OfflinePlayground: Develop peer-to-peer apps with no cloud connection. This
   mode offers no security and must only be used for development.
 - OnlineWithAuthentication: Run Ditto in secure production mode, logging on to
   Ditto Cloud or on on-premises authentication server. User permissions are
   centrally managed.
 - OnlinePlayground: Test a Ditto Cloud app with weak shared token
   authentication ("Playground mode"). This mode is not secure and must only be
   used for development.
 - SharedKey: A mode where any device is trusted provided they know the secret
   key. This is a simplistic authentication model normally only suitable for
   private apps where users and devices are both trusted.
 - Manual: A manually-provided certificate identity. This accepts a
   base64-encoded bundle.

 Creates an OnlineWithAuthentication identity.

 OnlineWithAuthentication identities should be used when running Ditto in secure
 production mode, logging on to Ditto Cloud, or using an on-premises
 authentication server. User permissions are centrally managed. Sync will not
 work until a successful login has occurred.

 The only required configuration is the application's UUID, which can be found
 on the Ditto portal where the app is registered, and an authentication
 callback. If you want to configure a custom auth URL or specify that you don't
 want cloud sync to be used then use one of the other
 `initOnlineWithAuthentication`-prefixed methods.

 By default cloud sync is enabled. This means the SDK will sync to a Big Peer in
 Ditto's cloud when an internet connection is available. This is controlled by
 the `enableDittoCloudSync` parameter found in the other
 `initOnlineWithAuthentication`-prefixed methods. If `true` (default), a
 suitable wss:// URL will be added to the `TransportConfig`. To prevent cloud
 sync, or to specify your own URL later, pass `false`.

 Authentication requests are handled by Ditto's cloud by default, configured in
 the portal at https://portal.ditto.live.

 To use a different or on-premises authentication service, use the appropriate
 `initOnlineWithAuthentication`-prefixed method and pass a custom HTTPS base URL
 as the `customAuthURL` parameter.

 @param appID a UUID identifying this app registration on the Ditto portal,
 which can be found at https://portal.ditto.live.
 @param authenticationDelegate a handler for when Ditto requires
 (re)authentication.
