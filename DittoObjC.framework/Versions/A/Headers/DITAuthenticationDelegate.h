 Warns that the Ditto authentication token is getting old.

 Ditto will attempt to refresh tokens periodically, starting from halfway
 through the token's validity period. This reduces the risk of authentication
 expiring while the user is offline.

 The refresh will happen automatically if Ditto has a suitable refresh token. If
 new credentials are required, such as a third-party token or a
 username/password, then Ditto does not cache that information and you must
 submit it again using one of the `login` methods on `DITAuthenticator`.
