 A message-based communication channel to another peer in the mesh.

 When a DittoBusStream is received by any means, you must immediately set a delegate. This provides
 the notifications of incoming messages and other events.

 Outgoing messages can be enqueued using `enqueueMessage`. You must wait for the delegate method
 indicating that the enqueue was successful before calling this method again. This process provides
 backpressure so that your app does not send data more quickly than the network can deliver.
