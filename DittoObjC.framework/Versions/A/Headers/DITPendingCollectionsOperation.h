/**
 These objects are returned when calling `collections` on `DITStore`.

 They allow chaining of further collections-related functions. You can either call `exec` on the
 object to get an array of `DITCollection`s as an immediate return value, or you can establish
 either a live query or a subscription, which both work over time.

 A live query, established by calling `observeLocal`, will notify you every time there's a change in
 the collections that the device knows about.

 A subscription, established by calling `subscribe`, will act as a signal to other peers that
 you would like to receive updates from them about the collections that they know about.

 Typically, an app would set up a `subscribe` in some part of the application which is long-lived to
 ensure the device receives updates from the mesh. These updates will be automatically received and
 written into the local store. Elsewhere, where you need to use this data, an `observeLocal` can be
 used to notify you of the data, and all subsequent changes to the data.

 If you want to observe changes in such a way that you can signal when you're ready for the live
 query to deliver a new update then you can call `observeLocalWithNextSignal`.
